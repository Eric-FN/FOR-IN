📝 **Dynamic Paragraph Style Changer**

This project demonstrates how to dynamically change the style of HTML paragraphs using JavaScript. It selects all `<p>` elements, changes their background color, and text color based on the body's background color, showcasing the power of JavaScript in manipulating the DOM.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS (with custom properties and Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

📁 **Project Structure:**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure for the page and the paragraphs whose styles will be changed dynamically.
- `css/style.css`: Contains the page layout styles, including responsive design and custom theme settings using CSS variables.
- `js/main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to:
  - Select all paragraphs on the page.
  - Change the text and background color of the paragraphs dynamically based on the page’s body background color.

⚡ **Features:**
- Dynamically modifies the style of `<p>` elements by changing text color and background color.
- Uses `getComputedStyle` to fetch the background color of the body and apply it to the paragraphs.
- Custom and responsive layout with a modern design using Google Fonts and CSS variables.

🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The page will display a set of paragraphs, and upon loading, their background and text colors will automatically change.

Perfect for practicing DOM manipulation and working with CSS properties in JavaScript. 💻📑
